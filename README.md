# HW 3: Prim's algorithm

![BuildStatus](https://github.com/zoechen0717/BMI203_HW3-PRIM-MST/workflows/badge.svg?event=push)

## **ðŸ“Œ Project Overview**
This project implements **Primâ€™s Algorithm** to construct a **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)** from a given adjacency matrix representation of a **connected, undirected graph**. The MST is represented as an adjacency matrix, ensuring the lowest possible sum of edge weights.

The implementation includes:
- **Graph class** for loading and processing adjacency matrices.
- **Primâ€™s Algorithm** for MST construction.
- **Unit tests** to verify correctness using sample graphs.

---

## **ðŸ“– Method Description**
This method is implemented based on **Primâ€™s Algorithm**. The pseudocode used in this project is adapted from **[freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/prims-algorithm-explained-with-pseudocode/)**, while the Python implementation of the MST adjacency matrix is developed based on **[GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/prims-algorithm-in-python/)**.

- **Initialize the MST** by selecting an arbitrary starting node. Keep track of visited nodes and the minimum edge weights needed to connect each node to the MST.
- **Use a priority queue (min heap)** to efficiently select the smallest edge that connects a new node to the MST.
- **Expand the MST step by step** by adding the minimum-weight edge, marking the new node as visited, and updating the smallest known edges for its neighbors.
- **Repeat the process until all nodes are included**, ensuring that exactly \(n-1\) edges are in the MST.
- **Construct the MST adjacency matrix**, ensuring it correctly represents the final tree and maintains symmetry for the undirected graph.

#### **ðŸ’¡ Key Features**
- Uses **Prim's Algorithm** with a **priority queue (heap)** for efficiency.
- Ensures **correct MST structure** by tracking **parent nodes**.
- Constructs an **undirected** MST (symmetric adjacency matrix).
- **Time Complexity**: **O(E log V)** using a heap for edge selection.
